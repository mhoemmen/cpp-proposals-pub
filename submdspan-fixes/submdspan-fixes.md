# Revision History

* Revision 0 submitted 2024-07-14

    * LEWG reviewed this version 2024-10-15, and voted to forward the [mdspan.sub] changes (with the [mdspan.syn], i.e., the "accept user-defined pair types" part, removed) to LWG.  LEWG also asked that we increment the `submdspan` feature test macro `__cpp_lib_submdspan` from its current value (`202403L`, set by adoption of P2642R6 ("Padded mdspan layouts") into the Working Draft for C++26).

* Revision 1 to be submitted for the 2024-10-16 mailing

    * Remove "user-defined pair types as slices" feature.  We will make this a separate paper.

    * Increment `__cpp_lib_submdspan` from its current value (`202403L`).

    * Implement suggestion during LEWG wording review to define a "wording macro" for all the slice specifier types that have unit stride.  We call it *unit-stride slice for `M`*, where `M` is a layout mapping type.  (The definition only depends on an `index_type`, but the wording is most natural when it depends on the layout mapping type for which _`submdspan-mapping-impl`_ is a private member function.)

* Revision 2 to be submitted for the next mailing

    * Use green and red text in Wording to make changes more clear.  No actual wording changes.

# Abstract

We propose to change `submdspan_mapping` for the following layouts' layout mappings:

* `layout_left`,
* `layout_right`,
* `layout_left_padded`, and
* `layout_right_padded`,

so that a `strided_slice` slice with compile-time unit stride results in the returned mapping having the same layout as if the slice were a pair of integers.  This preserves compile-time optimization information for common layouts.

This change needs to be merged into the Working Draft before C++26.  Otherwise, it would be a breaking change.

# Motivation and design discussion

## Vectorization example

Suppose that one wants to vectorize a 1-D array copy operation using `mdspan` and `aligned_accessor` (P2897).  One has a `copy_8_floats` function that optimizes the special case of copying a contiguous array of 8 `float`s, where the start of the array is aligned to `8 * sizeof(float)` (32) bytes.  In practice, plenty of libraries exist to optimize 1-D array copy.  This is just an example that simplifies the use cases for explicit 8-wide SIMD enough to show in a brief proposal.

```c++
template<class ElementType, size_t ext, size_t byte_alignment>
using aligned_array_view = mdspan<ElementType,
  extents<int, ext>, layout_right,
  aligned_accessor<ElementType, byte_alignment>>;

void
copy_8_floats(aligned_array_view<const float, 8, 32> src,
  aligned_array_view<float, 8, 32> dst)
{
  // One would instead use a hardware instruction for aligned copy,
  // or a "simd" or "unroll" pragma.
  for (int k = 0; k < 8; ++k) {
    dst[k] = src[k];
  }
}
```

The natural next step would be to use `copy_8_floats` to implement copying 1-D `float` arrays by the usual "strip-mining" approach.

```c++
template<class ElementType>
using array_view = mdspan<ElementType, dims<1, int>>;

void slow_copy(array_view<const float> src, array_view<float> dst)
{
  assert(src.extent(0) == dst.extent(0));
  for (int k = 0; k < src.extent(0); ++k) {
    dst[k] = src[k];
  }
}

template<size_t vector_length>
void strip_mined_copy(
  aligned_array_view<const float, dynamic_extent,
    vector_length * sizeof(float)> src,
  aligned_array_view<      float, dynamic_extent,
    vector_length * sizeof(float)> dst)
{
  assert(src.extent(0) == dst.extent(0));
  assert(src.extent(0) % vector_length == 0);

  for (int beg = 0; beg < src.extent(0); beg += vector_length) {
    constexpr auto one = std::integral_constant<int, 1>{};
    constexpr auto vec_len = std::integral_constant<int, vector_length>{};

    // Using strided_slice lets the extent be a compile-time constant.
    // tuple{beg, beg + vector_length} would result in dynamic_extent.
    constexpr auto vector_slice =
      strided_slice{.offset=dst_lower, .extent=vector_length, .stride=one};

    // PROBLEM: Current wording makes this always layout_stride,
    // but we know that it could be layout_right.
    auto src_slice = submdspan(src, vector_slice);
    auto dst_slice = submdspan(dst, vector_slice);

    copy_8_floats(src_slice, dst_slice);
  }
}

void copy(array_view<const float> src, array_view<float> dst)
{
  assert(src.extent(0) == dst.extent(0));
  constexpr int vector_length = 8;

  // Handle possibly unaligned prefix of less than vector_length elements. 
  auto aligned_starting_index = [](auto* ptr) {
    constexpr auto v = static_cast<unsigned>(vector_length);
    auto ptr_value = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(ptr_value);
    auto remainder = ptr_value % v;
    return static_cast<int>(ptr_value + (v - remainder) % v);
  };
  int src_beg = aligned_starting_index(src.data());
  int dst_beg = aligned_starting_index(dst.data());
  if (src_beg != dst_beg) {
    slow_copy(src, dst);
    return;
  }
  slow_copy(submdspan(src, tuple{0, src_beg}),
    submdspan(dst, tuple{0, dst_beg}));

  // Strip-mine the aligned vector_length segments of the array.
  int src_end = (src.size() / vector_length) * vector_length;
  int dst_end = (dst.size() / vector_length) * vector_length;
  strip_mined_copy<8>(submdspan(src, tuple{src_beg, src_end}),
    submdspan(dst, tuple{dst_beg, dst_end}));

  // Handle suffix of less than vector_length elements.
  slow_copy(submdspan(src, tuple{src_end, src.extent(0)}),
    submdspan(dst, tuple{dst_end, dst.extent(0)}));
}
```

The `strip_mined_copy` function must use `strided_slice` to get slices of 8 elements at a time, rather than `tuple`.  This ensures that the resulting extent is a compile-time constant 8, even though the slice starts at a run-time index `beg`.

## Issues with C++ Working Draft

The current C++ Working Draft has two issues that hinder optimization of the above code.

1. The above `submdspan` results always have `layout_stride`, even though we know that they are contiguous and thus should have `layout_right`.

2. The `submdspan` operations in `strip_mined_copy` should result in `aligned_accessor` with 32-byte alignment, but instead give `default_accessor`.  This is because `aligned_accessor`'s `offset` member function takes the offset as a `size_t`.  This discards compile-time information, namely that the offset can be expressed as the product of some integer and the overalignment factor, where the overalignment factor is known at compile time.

## What this proposal does and doesn't change

This proposal fixes (1) for all layouts currently in the Working Draft that have a `submdspan_mapping` customization: `layout_left`, `layout_right`, `layout_left_padded`, and `layout_right_padded`.  We can do that without breaking changes, as long as this proposal is merged before C++26 is finalized.  After that, merging the proposal would be a breaking change.

This proposal does _not_ fix (2), because that would require a breaking change to both the layout mapping requirements and the accessor requirements, and because it would complicate both of them quite a bit.

## Why we don't try to fix `aligned_accessor::offset`

Regarding (2), <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/views.multidim#mdspan.submdspan.submdspan-6">**[mdspan.submdspan.submdspan]** 6</a> says that `submdspan(src, slices...)` has effects equivalent to the following.

```c++
auto sub_map_offset = submdspan_mapping(src.mapping(), slices...);
return mdspan(src.accessor().offset(src.data(), sub_map_offset.offset),
              sub_map_offset.mapping,
              AccessorPolicy::offset_policy(src.accessor()));
```

The problem is `AccessorPolicy::offset_policy(src.accessor())`.  The type `offset_policy` is the wrong type in this case, `default_accessor<const float>` instead of `aligned_accessor<const float, 32>`.  If we want an offset with suitable compile-time alignment to have a different accessor type, then we would need at least the following changes.

1. The Standard Library would need a new type that represents the product of a compile-time integer (that is, an _`integral-constant-like`_ type) and a "run-time" integer (an `integral`-not-`bool` type).  It would need overloaded arithmetic operators that preserve this product form as much as possible.  For example, $8x + 4$ for a run-time integer $x$ should result in $4y$ where $y = 2x + 1$ is a run-time integer.

2. At least the Standard layout mappings' `operator()` would need to compute with these types and return them if possible.  The layout mapping requirements would thus need to change, as currently `operator()` must return `index_type` (see <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/mdspan.layout.reqmts#7">**[[mdspan.layout.reqmts]]** 7</a>).

3. `aligned_accessor::offset` would need an overload taking a type that expresses the product of a compile-time integer (of suitable alignment) and a run-time integer.  The accessor requirements <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/mdspan.accessor.reqmts">**[[mdspan.accessor.reqmts]]**</a> may also need to change to permit this.

4. The definition of `submdspan` would need some way to get the accessor type corresponding to the new `offset` overload, instead of `aligned_accessor::offset_policy` (which in this case is `default_accessor`).

The work-around is to convert the result of `submdspan` by hand to use the desired accessor.  In the above `copy` example, one would replace the line
```c++
    copy_8_floats(src_slice, dst_slice);
```
with the following, that depends on `aligned_accessor`'s `explicit` constructor from `default_accessor`.
```c++
    copy_8_floats(aligned_array_view<const float, 8, 32>{src},
      aligned_array_view<float, 8, 32>{dst});
```
Given that this work-around is easy to do, should only be needed for a few special cases, and avoids a big design change to the accessor policy requirements, we don't propose trying to fix this issue in the C++ Working Draft.
